## Introduction
This project is the first project launched by DataBeez for interested candidates to participate in a technical test as part of their recruitment process for the profile of Data Scientist/Analyst with skills in modeling, development, and data visualization.

## Project Description
The project involves the analysis of credit scoring for the German Credit Data. The tasks to be completed are as folllows:  
1. Explore the data to look for the greatest correlations with whether or not credit is granted
2. Develop a credit scoring prediction model.
3. Create a Dockerfile for deployment.
4. Host the code on GitHub or GitLab.
5. Create an interactive dashboard via Power BI or Looker Studio to visualize the model results.

The project will be completed by two Contributors:  
* [Edwige Songong](https://github.com/Songonge)
* [EKLOU Kossi Dodji](https://github.com/ekd001)

Since [Edwige Songong](https://github.com/Songonge) has a Data Analyst profile, she will be working on point 5 of the above description, while [EKLOU Kossi Dodji](https://github.com/ekd001) will be working on the first four points.

## About the Dataset
The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle using the link provided by the Recruitment Team. It contains 1000 entries with 20 categorial/symbolic attributes prepared by Prof. Hofmann. In this dataset, each entry represents a person who takes a credit by a bank. Each person is classified as good or bad credit risks according to the set of attributes.  
[Link to the dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabure/german-credit-data-with-risk?resource=download)

The dataset was made of 1000 rows and 11 columns with demographic and financial information. The column are described as follows:
* *Age*: The age of the person asking for credit
* *Sex*: The sex of the person asking for credit
* *Job*: The job category of the person asking for credit
* *Housing*: The status of the housing of the person asking for credit
* *Saving accounts*: The saving account owned by of the person asking for credit
* *Checking account*: The checking account owned by of the person asking for credit
* *Credit amount*: The credit amount the person asking for credit
* *Duration*: Duration of the credit in month
* *Purpose*: Purpose for the credit

## Importing the Dataset to the Database
To import the dataset to the SQL Server database, I proceeded as follows:  
* Launched the database and connected the to it
* Right-clicked on the database name > selected Tasks > selected Import data from the menu
* In the new window that appears, I clicked on Next
* Used the drop down menu and selected Flat File Source > Next
* Clicked on Browse > selected the file from my computer > Open
* Selected Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server from the drop down menu > Next > Next > Finish  
The above steps successfully imported the dataset into my database in SQL Server.

## Preparation of the Dataset: Cleaning and Transforming
In SQL Server, the following tasks were completed.

### Renamed Columns
To rename columns for consistency, the queries below were executed.
* Renamed the Saving accounts column to SavingAccount
```
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Project1.[Saving accounts]', 'SavingAccount', 'COLUMN';
```
* Renamed the Checking accounts column to CheckingAccount
```
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Project1.[Checking account]', 'CheckingAccount', 'COLUMN';
```
* Renamed the Credit amount column to CreditAmount
```
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Project1.[Credit amount]', 'CreditAmount', 'COLUMN'; 
```
* Renamed the Risk column to CreditRisk
```
EXEC sp_rename 'dbo.Project1.Risk', 'CreditRisk', 'COLUMN';
```

### Replaced NA in some Columns 
* To reduce the amount of NA in the SavingAccount column, I filled rows with NA in the SavingAccount column with values in the CheckingAccount column using the query below:
```
UPDATE p1
SET p1.SavingAccount = p2.CheckingAccount
FROM [DataBeez].dbo.Project1 p1
JOIN [DataBeez].dbo.Project1 p2
	ON p1.id = p2.id
WHERE p1.SavingAccount = 'NA' 
``` 
**Output**: 183 rows were updated in the SavingAccount column.

* To reduce the amount of NA in the CheckingAccount column, I filled rows with NA in the SavingAccount column with values in the SavingAccount column using the query below:
```
UPDATE p1
SET p1.CheckingAccount = p2.SavingAccount
FROM [DataBeez].dbo.Project1 p1
JOIN [DataBeez].dbo.Project1 p2
	ON p1.id = p2.id
WHERE p1.CheckingAccount = 'NA';
```
**Output**: 183 rows were updated in the CheckingAccount column.

### Checked and Deleted NA values  
* Checked rows with NA in both the SavingAccount and the CheckingAccount columns.
```
SELECT *
FROM [DataBeez].dbo.Project1
WHERE SavingAccount = 'NA' AND CheckingAccount = 'NA';  
```
Output:  99 rows

* Deleted rows with NA in the SavingAccount and CheckingAccount columns.
```
DELETE FROM [DataBeez].dbo.Project1
WHERE SavingAccount = 'NA' AND CheckingAccount = 'NA';  
```
Output: 99 rows were deleted 

* Now, running the query below returned 901 rows.
```
SELECT *
FROM [DataBeez].dbo.Project1;
```

## Importing the Cleaned Data to Power BI where to Analyse it  
After launching Power BI, I connected to the data as follows:  
* Clicked on Get data under the Home tab within the Data group
* Selected SQL Server from the list
* Entered the Server name and the database name in each cell
* Clicked on OK. This opened a popup window.
* Ticked on the table and clicked on Load. This loaded the data in Power BI.

## Data Analysis in Power BI
1. **Created DAX Measures for Analysis**  
   * *Total Male*
```
Total Male = COUNTROWS(FILTER(Project1, Project1[Sex] = "male"))
```
   * *Total Female*
```
Total Female = COUNTROWS(FILTER(Project1, Project1[Sex] = "female"))
```
   * *Total Credit Amount*
```
Total Credit Amount = SUM(Project1[CreditAmount])
```
   * *Average Credit Amount by Risk Level*
```
Avg Credit Amount = AVERAGE(Project1[CreditAmount])
```
   * *Percentage of "Good" and "Bad" Risks*
```
Good Credit Risk Percentage = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Project1), Project1[Risk] = "good"), COUNTROWS(Project1), 0) 
```
```
Bad Credit Risk Percentage = DIVIDE(CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Project1), Project1[Risk] = "bad"), COUNTROWS(Project1), 0)
``` 
   * *Average Age*
```
Average Age = AVERAGE(Project1[Age])
```
   * *Average Credit Duration*
```
Average Credit Duration = AVERAGE(Project1[Duration])
```

2. **Created a Calculated Column**  
* Risk Classification based on Credit Amount
```
Risk Category =  IF(Project1[CreditAmount] > 5000, "High Risk", "Low Risk")
```

## Data Visualization in Power BI
* Created Bar charts to showcase the credit amount by purpose and by checking and saving accounts.
* Created Line charts to showcase the credit amount by duration, age and risk category, and age and sex.
* Created donut charts to showcase the credit amount by risk category and housing.
* Created donut charts to showcase the percentage of good vs. bad credit risk.
* Used cards to show the total credit amount, average credit amount, total number of people who applied for credit, the average age, and the average credit duration. 
* Used slicers for sex, housing, credit risk, and risk category to make the dashboard interactive.

## Insights from the Data Analysis
1. **Total Credit Distribution by Purpose**  
   * *Observation*: The majority of credit was issued for cars ($1.05M), followed by radio/TV ($609K) and furniture/equipment ($541K). 
   * *Insight*: These top three loan purposes make up a significant share of the total credit portfolio. Education loans and repairs contribute very little comparatively. The least credit was for domestic appliances.

2. **Credit Risk Analysis**  
   * *Observation*:
     * Good Risk accounts for 60.8%, while Bad Risk makes up 39.2% of the credit issued.
     * High Risk (55.1%) slightly outweighs Low Risk (44.9%), indicating moderate portfolio risk.
   * *Insight*: Despite a majority of "good risk" borrowers, a significant proportion of loans are in the "bad risk" category, requiring further risk management strategies.

3. **Savings and Checking Accounts vs. Credit Amount**  
   * *Observation*:
     * Borrowers with little saving accounts took the highest credit amount ($2.03M), followed by those with moderate savings ($543K).
     * Similarly, borrowers with little checking accounts account for the largest credit amount ($1.42M).
   * *Insight*: Borrowers with minimal financial reserves (savings or checking) are receiving the majority of the loans, which could lead to a higher default risk.
4. **Credit by Age and Duration**  
   * *Observation*:
     * Credit amounts are concentrated among borrowers aged 20–40 years.
     * Loan durations vary widely, with peaks around 20-40 months.
   * *Insight*: The age group 20–40 is highly active in borrowing. Longer durations could lead to repayment challenges for certain risk categories.
5. **Housing Status and Credit Distribution**  
   * *Observation*:
     * Borrowers with own housing account for the largest share of credit ($1.94M), followed by those renting ($494K) and those with free housing ($452K).
   * *Insight*: Housing ownership correlates with a higher credit share, which may indicate a lower default likelihood compared to renters.

## Recommendations from the Data Analysis
1. **Strengthen Risk Management for High-Risk Borrowers**    
   * Implement stricter risk evaluation criteria for borrowers with little savings and checking accounts, as they dominate the loan portfolio but may struggle with repayments.  
2. **Focus on Diversifying Loan Purpose**  
   * Reduce overreliance on car loans by incentivizing loans for purposes like education or business that offer long-term societal and economic benefits.
3.	**Segment by Age and Duration**  
   * For the 20-40 age group, offer shorter-duration loan products to reduce repayment risks.  
   * Monitor repayment patterns on loans exceeding 40 months.
4.	**Encourage Savings Accounts**  
   * Promote savings-linked loans, where borrowers must demonstrate financial reserves before taking loans. This will improve borrower resilience and motivate the repayment within delays.
5.	**Housing and Credit Policy**  
   * For renters and those with "free housing," introduce additional collateral requirements or pre-approval processes to mitigate risk.
6.	**Enhanced Monitoring of 'Bad Risk' Loans**  
   * Use predictive analytics to identify early warning signals for borrowers categorized as "bad risk" and implement intervention strategies (e.g., repayment reminders, restructuring options).

## Conclusion
The dashboard reveals that a large portion of loans are issued to younger borrowers (20–40 years old) with minimal financial reserves and are concentrated in car-related purposes. While most borrowers fall under the "good risk" category, a significant proportion are still high-risk borrowers.
To improve credit portfolio stability:  
* Diversify loan purposes,
* Implement risk-based loan policies,
* Encourage savings-linked borrowing practices.  
By addressing these areas, the organization can better manage credit risk and optimize loan performance for long-term sustainability.
